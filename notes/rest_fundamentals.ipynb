    "A server or backend houses REST endpoints, with connection to a database and connection to a client.  \n",

    "This endpoint could be specified to /users/{id} to GET a specific user ID from the server and display it on the client.   \n",
    "Client side code is all viewable in the web so you obviously cant connect the client directly to the DB, SQL injection lol.   \n",
